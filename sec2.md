The NIST Framework
The NIST Cybersecurity Framework is an optional framework published by NIST, originally developed to protect critical infrastructure in the US from cyber threats.

NIST Logo

The NIST framework consists of five main elements:

Identify - Identify and understand the threats and risks the organization is likely to face.
Protect - Protect the organizationâ€™s assets from those threats and risks.
Detect - Detect incidents, such as cyberattacks or other events.
Respond - Respond to incidents, preventing further damage.
Recover - Recover from incidents, evaluating how to prevent reoccurrence cleaning up any damage that occurred.
Frameworks are not generally a one-size-fits-all solution to cybersecurity. Instead, they are a starting point for organizations to customize to their needs and threats. Frameworks and regulations are meant to work together, helping the organizations we rely on to remain secure, and protecting our information from those who would misuse it.
