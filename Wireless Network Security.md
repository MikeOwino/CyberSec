Protocols and security measures are keeping up with the advent of Wi-Fi. With Wi-Fi, users have experienced an increase in device freedom, but wireless technology carries the risk that we are may not physically see who is accessing a network.

### Network Segmentation
Network Segmentation is the basic practice of breaking apart larger networks into smaller, functionally similar networks with different access levels. This improves both security and performance.

Generally, when using network segmentation, we want to consider the role of each segmented network. For example, in an organization, does a computer in the Human Resources department need access to the servers used by the Engineering department or the Marketing department? Most likely no. Should a friend visiting the office be able to access the company login portal? Definitely not!
