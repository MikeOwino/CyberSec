### Cybersecurity is Important for Everyone
Cyber threats don’t just affect large organizations or governments. If you’re connected to the digital world, you are also at risk! Even seemingly safe activities like using email, online shopping, phone apps, ordering food online, and more could open you up to attacks.

In this unit, you’ll learn some best practices for individuals as well as ways to harden and secure your personal device. We’ll explore different security tools as well as built-in security options on your devices.

### Personal Security Best Practices

A great place to start applying your new knowledge of cybersecurity is to start with the security of your own accounts and devices! We can keep ourselves safe online by implementing best practices, choosing more secure tools, and keeping our knowledge and systems up to date.

Account Safety & Password Management
Passwords are everywhere. A study in February 2020 found that the average person has more than 70-80 passwords. With everything from your email to your local pizza place requiring a password to use, it’s no surprise that up to 65% of people reuse the same password for multiple accounts.

But why does this matter? After all, even if your bank account and your streaming account use the same password, nobody is going to guess if the password is based on your mother’s favorite recipe, are they? This might be surprising, but it doesn’t take much to guess. Today, there are common methods to guess passwords in a variety of ways, such as brute-forcing, credential stuffing, dictionary attacks, and rainbow tables.

Don’t Reuse the Same Password for Many Sites
A bank may be less likely to suffer a security breach, but what about all the other websites we use? By some metrics, 30,000 websites are hacked every day. When people hack into the website of a small company and steal the usernames and passwords of users, they are then able to use freely available credential stuffing tools to automatically try those username and password combinations across thousands of other sites.

Use Strong Passwords or Passphrases
The more characters, different capitalizations, special symbols a password has, the harder it is to “brute-force”. You can try How Secure is My Password? to see how long it could take to brute force your password. Is your password “password”? That would take 0.29 milliseconds to guess. How about “w324kj&^lsdj”? That would take 25,937,833 millennia.

Disclaimer: Don’t go putting your password into just any “password testing” site! These are two that we trust, but others might try to store your password for malicious purposes.”

Use a Password Manager
A password manager is software that usually comes in a browser extension form, and it stores all of your passwords in encrypted form so that you don’t have to remember all of them individually. Instead, you only have to remember one master password. Even the United States government recommends using one!

Set Multi-Factor Authentication
Make sure you use two-factor authentication (2FA) and multi-factor authentication (MFA) wherever and whenever possible. Every extra authentication step adds a layer of protection. At the very least, 2FA should be enabled for high-value accounts such as your bank account. Tools like the Google Authenticator App or YubiKey make code-based MFA more convenient.

Using Virtual Private Networks
Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) are a pretty cool tool. With the click of a button, you can be browsing the Internet disguised as a device from Paris, or Beirut, or Kinshasa.

Of course, the drawback is that accessing the Internet through a VPN can slow down your internet experience, and VPN services usually cost money. But VPNs are an essential tool because they provide two things: anonymity and security.
