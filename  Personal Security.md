### Cybersecurity is Important for Everyone
Cyber threats don’t just affect large organizations or governments. If you’re connected to the digital world, you are also at risk! Even seemingly safe activities like using email, online shopping, phone apps, ordering food online, and more could open you up to attacks.

In this unit, you’ll learn some best practices for individuals as well as ways to harden and secure your personal device. We’ll explore different security tools as well as built-in security options on your devices.

### Personal Security Best Practices

A great place to start applying your new knowledge of cybersecurity is to start with the security of your own accounts and devices! We can keep ourselves safe online by implementing best practices, choosing more secure tools, and keeping our knowledge and systems up to date.

Account Safety & Password Management
Passwords are everywhere. A study in February 2020 found that the average person has more than 70-80 passwords. With everything from your email to your local pizza place requiring a password to use, it’s no surprise that up to 65% of people reuse the same password for multiple accounts.

But why does this matter? After all, even if your bank account and your streaming account use the same password, nobody is going to guess if the password is based on your mother’s favorite recipe, are they? This might be surprising, but it doesn’t take much to guess. Today, there are common methods to guess passwords in a variety of ways, such as brute-forcing, credential stuffing, dictionary attacks, and rainbow tables.

Don’t Reuse the Same Password for Many Sites
A bank may be less likely to suffer a security breach, but what about all the other websites we use? By some metrics, 30,000 websites are hacked every day. When people hack into the website of a small company and steal the usernames and passwords of users, they are then able to use freely available credential stuffing tools to automatically try those username and password combinations across thousands of other sites.
